# Overview Cache_replacement_DRL

This is the code to show the results of the paper "Learning-Based Joint User Association and Cache Replacement in Small Cell Networks" by Sang eun jeon and Jae wook jung.

User association and content caching in small cell networks (SCNs) are widely studied to accommodate tremendous media traffic and alleviate the bottleneck of backhaul links. SCNs are appropriate for serving users with reducing transmission latency by properly caching the contents based on request distribution. We tackle the problem with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that considers the content transmission process and caching of small cells to facilitatees learning.

The application uses Pytorch backend on PyCharm: JetBrains. Our paper covers several algorithms that make user association and content replacement decisions in SBS to minimize latency in wireless communication in a cacheable small cell network. I assumed a cacheable small cell network realistically. The network environment assumes a small Rayleigh fading model, and various environments can be simulated by adjusting the environment parameters. The end goal for this is to implement a reinforcement learning-based trained algorithm using a deep neural network (DNN).
